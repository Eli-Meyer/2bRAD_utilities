2bRAD analysis pipeline version 1
This version reflects the approach described in the 2012 methods paper

This repository contains a series of scripts used for our standard 2bRAD analysis pipeline.
You'll also need the "sequence utilities" and "sequence processing" repositories, and several 
other software packages or modules installed and in your path:
BioPerl			http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Main_Page
SHRiMP			http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/shrimp/
cross_match.manyreads	http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html

The usage information for each script (usage.txt) can be reproduced by running each script without arguments.

Any questions or bugs? Please contact Eli Meyer: eli.meyer@science.oregonstate.edu.
